# Ask2Slide

**Ask2Slide** is a visual RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system that enables intelligent, dialogue-driven interaction with slide-based content.

Instead of treating documents as plain text, Ask2Slide leverages the power of **Qwen2.5-VL**, a multimodal large language model, to understand and retrieve **Slides** as visually structured artifacts â€” preserving layout, tables, figures, and semantic intent.

## ðŸš€ Features

- ðŸŽ¯ **Visual-first Retrieval**: Retrieve the most relevant slide content based on user queries, powered by visual embeddings rather than token sequences.
- ðŸ§  **Q&A, Slide Summarization & Suggestion**: Use natural language to ask questions, get summaries, or generate suggestions for building your own presentation.
- ðŸ’¬ **Conversational Slide Composer**: Ask2Slide not only indexes slides, but also helps organize talking points, narration scripts, and logical flow for a compelling presentation.
